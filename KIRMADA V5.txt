KIRMADA V5 PATCH NOTES--



UPDATE 1--Identity Shift Activated__-

Kirmada is no more...
Say hello to Bakaiti.ai –
a smarter, wilder, and unapologetically chaotic version of the original AI notes tool.
The name may be funny, but the output is still sharp.

*Previously known as Kirmada V3 | Now reborn as Bakaiti.ai*



Update 2 – UI Polish & Layout Enhancements


The interface receives its first major visual enhancement since the rebrand. This update improves overall usability, readability, and user experience without altering the app’s core behavior.

Redesigned Search Box:
Rounded entry field for a modern and clean look.

Smart Placeholder Behavior:
Default placeholder text ("Search...") now automatically disappears as the user begins typing.

Optional Rounded Output Area:
The output display has been adjusted to optionally match the curvy aesthetic for visual consistency.

Improved Font Rendering & Spacing:
Subtle typography and layout adjustments to improve clarity and reduce visual fatigue.



Update 3 – Incognito Session Toggle

Users can now activate incognito mode from their profile to prevent recent topics from being saved during that session.


Update 4 – Executable Icon Support


EXE now supports custom .ico icon during build via pyinstaller
Personalized branding now possible for desktop use
